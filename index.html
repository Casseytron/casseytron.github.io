<h2>Things I Like</h2>

<p>
    Some of my favourite things to do are drawing, gaming and reading. I like to drw things from my favourite games, Phoenix Wright, Pokemon and League of Legends. My favourite colour is white and one of my favourite book series is Harry Potter. The animals I like the most are Orcas (fweet fweet) and birds.
